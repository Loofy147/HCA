Hello, world!
This is a small dataset for the HCA model.
It contains simple text to test the data loading and training pipeline.
The goal is to verify that the model can learn from a real, albeit small, text file.
HCA is a novel architecture, and this is the first step in training it on actual data.
Let's see how it performs!
Goodbye, world!
